Browser's HTMLParser parses the the html document(tree like document) into an in-memory representation
called DOM (document object).

document.readyState = loading/interactive/complete

document.readyState = loading
1.HTML Parser starts parsing the html and add the html elements to the dom (document object).
2.When a <script> tag is seen, the HTML Parser is paused and the script is synchronously (externally sourced
with src attribute are downloaded first) and executed.
3.HTML Parser continues parsing the remaining html.

Once all the html is parsed and element nodes added to the dom(document)
document.readyState = interactive
1. domContentLoadedEvent is fired on the window object and then <images> and other files are downloaded.

Finally
document.readyState = complete
