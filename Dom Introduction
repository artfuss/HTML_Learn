Browser's HTMLParser parses the the html document(tree like document) into an in-memory representation
called DOM (document object).

document.readyState = loading/interactive/complete

document.readyState = loading
1.HTML Parser starts parsing the html and add the html elements to the dom (document object).
2.When a <script> tag is seen, the HTML Parser is paused and the script is synchronously (externally sourced
with src attribute are downloaded first) and executed.
3.HTML Parser continues parsing the remaining html.

Once all the html is parsed and element nodes added to the dom(document)
document.readyState = interactive
1. domContentLoadedEvent is fired on the document object and then <images> and other files are downloaded.

Finally
document.readyState = complete


<script src....> </script> - synchronous execution, pause the html parser and execute
<script asyn src..></script> - asynchronous execution, execute script and continue html parsing simultaneously
<script defered src..></script> - defered execution, wait for parsing to complete (document.readyState = interactive) before 
                                  starting the execution of the script.
